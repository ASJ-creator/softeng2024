            <h2>My Personal Smart Farm Project: Powered by Raspberry Pi 5</h2>
            <p>
              I created a small smart farm using Raspberry Pi 5 and various sensors to experience modern agricultural technology and 
              learn how to efficiently manage plants. This project was designed as a hands-on approach to merging technology with sustainable 
              farming practices.
            </p>
          
            <h3>Key Features of the Project:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Environmental Monitoring System:</strong> Real-time temperature and humidity measurements are conducted using a 
                <em>temperature and humidity sensor</em>. The data is collected and stored on the Raspberry Pi and displayed on a web dashboard for easy access.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Automated Irrigation System:</strong> A <em>soil moisture sensor</em> detects the soil?s condition and automatically 
                waters the plants when needed. This system focuses on conserving water while optimizing plant growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Camera-Based Plant Monitoring:</strong> With the <em>Raspberry Pi Camera Module</em>, I added real-time monitoring to 
                observe the plants' condition. An IR filter enables nighttime observation of plant health.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Smart Lighting Control:</strong> <em>LED lights</em> are programmed to turn on and off according to the plants? 
                photosynthesis needs, ensuring an optimal light cycle.
              </li>
            </ul>
          
            <h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Raspberry Pi 5</li>
              <li>Python and Django framework</li>
              <li>Various IoT sensors and modules</li>
              <li>Real-time data visualization and control via a web interface</li>
            </ul>
          
            <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
            <p>
              Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with IoT and automation technologies and discovered how they solve real-world 
              problems. Collecting and analyzing environmental data highlighted the importance of data-driven decision-making in modern farming.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              Smart farm technology offers significant potential not only for large-scale agriculture but also for small, personal farms. This project 
              was a valuable opportunity to explore that potential firsthand.
            </p>
          
            <h3>Future Plans:</h3>
            <p>
              I plan to expand the system by adding more sensors to predict pest outbreaks and implement remote control features via a mobile app.
